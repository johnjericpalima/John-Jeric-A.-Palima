        <H4 style="text-align:center"> We know when you say this website or application you're mind will automatically said "SEARCH" because this is the use of this app/web. Google is the most biggest site in the world. Can you imagine that in the past we have mozilla firefox before this but this web is so easy to use when you search in this web you can get the information you want right away. and without google we cant use our search bar in our celluar phones. can you image you have cellphone but it has mozilla firefox. In iPhone they have own search web called safari but you can also download google in their models. </H4>

        <H4 style="text-align:center;"> I chose facebok because in facebook we can get some information that we need. And also we can post and share it to everyone. We all know facebook has a big impact to our society in terms of information. Also there are any features that facebook has. And for me facebook is the one of the best website to me because when you ask someone about application or website we will think about facebook. </H4>

        </center>
        
        <H4 style="text-align:center;"> I chose also Youtube because in terms of informative videos and documentaries you can search it in YouTube right away. Also when I was a kid I usually watch and listening some videos and musics in YouTube. YouTube also has something todo with music you can search what ever music you want. YouTube also we can't deny that all of us use this website/application because when it comes to music and videos YouTube is the most reliable web that you can use. and lastly YouTube nowadays is the new job because of the vloggers you can take a profit from making some videos but you need enough subscribers and watch for you to have a income.   </H4>

        <H4 style="text-align:center;"> I chose Messenger because of one reason. Messenger is the usable in terms of giving fast and precise information in a short period of time. Messenger is the one who can help you to know information and you can say what ever you want to say to those people you want to talk. Because messenger can make a call as long as you have a data connection or internet connection on your cellular phone or desktop. Wherever you are you can send a message through time to time. And lastly you dont need to anywhere to know the information you can just message your friend through this app to know what are the things you want to know.  </H4>

          <img src="Gmail-logo.png"alt="gmail" style="width:200px;height:110px;">
        </a>
        </center>
        
        <H4 style="text-align:center;"> I chose gmail because you can send email to other people without using mailman. In this era the mailman is the internet because if you don't have internet you can't send email to the others. And it is helpful to all companies because they can privately send email to their client. Also it will help us because we can use it when we sending our private information to the others like when we registring in schools like Cdm. So that the registrar and me are the one who will know the exact information that we want to know.   </H4>
